				<p><< Praise for <i>These Threads Who Lead to Bramble</i> >></p>
				<p>"By turns tender, erudite, and uncanny, the frequently biographical pieces collected here cover a lot of ground, from European composers to the history of the earth through road trips and onomastics. Haunted by undying dead fathers and ever drowning Ophelias, they are beautifully haunting. Russell Persson is a true original—-a latter-day alchemist, transmuting prosaic prose into unalloyed poetry. No one else writes like this; his style is sui generis."</p>
				<p>--Andrew Gallix, author of <i>Unwords</i></p>
				<p>"As its title suggests, <i>These Threads Who Lead to Bramble</i>> is not the kind of book where one thing predictably follows another. Anacoluthon, you might call it, if you were into that kind of thing. I suspect Russell Persson might have little time for such 'gussied-up' terminology. In truth, the serpentine sentences of this dazzling collection echo the connections that emerge between its subjects: memory and forgetting, love and loss, embodied genealogies of legacy and inheritance (the never simple passing down from fathers to sons of, say, admiration or resentment, the angle of a hairline or the precise timbre in which certain words might be spoken). Persson tells stories for which no other cartography can exist, recalls or imagines narratives that won't be verified, explores the myriad ways in which painting, drawing, photography and music might intervene in flows of meaning or in the construction of time. With memory a kind of erasure, and forgetfulness an ever-creative force, Persson gives us a twisting grammar of joyful tumblings. This is a book to read again and again."</p>
				<p>--Tom Jeffreys, editor of <i>Walking: Documents of Contemporary Art</i> and author of <i>The White Birch</i></p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>"In this sublime essay collection, novelist Persson interrogates the unreliability and inventiveness of historical memory... This astonishes. "</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><< Praise for <i>The Way of Florida</i> >></p>
				<p>"Dark, dark, dark, this incessantly numinous account of the funding of the planetary genius in which, at any cost, the terrible genies of appropriation disport themselves on native soil, makes for an unprecedented work of language gorgeously twisted by the torsions of narrative necessity. It also makes for a great book. Entrancing in its choral pursuit of the realities of man's irresistible consumption of man, <i>The Way of Florida</i> rushes Russell Persson to the fore of notable American novelists, men and women who refuse the conventions handed them and confound the vicious lures of the marketplace. Ah, good conscience tells me I might instead have simply-—and thus more truly-—said, "I'm floored.""</p>
				<p>--Gordon Lish</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>"<i>The Way of Florida</i> is, for the figures in the narrative, a doomed and reckless course. But for Russell Persson it is the manner by which he achieves absolute triumph. Here is a strange, bracing, wholly original novel, just when we need it."</p>
				<p>--Sam Lipsyte</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>"Russell Persson does with Cabeza de Vaca's narrative what Nick Cave did with traditional murder ballads: hones it, gives it a sharp edge, and makes it seem almost uncomfortably close. An incantatory and compelling read, one that will stick with you long after the book is closed."</p>
				<p>--Brian Evenson</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>"A beautiful and hallucinatory triumph."</p>
				<p>--Michael Kimball</p>
