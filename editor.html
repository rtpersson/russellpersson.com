				<p><< Manuscript Editing >></p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>I am an experienced and meticulous editor dedicated to working with authors to make a manuscript as good as it can be. With focused attention on your writing, we'll work together on a close line-by-line examination of sentences, rhythm, idiom, syntax, flow and logic. This work starts with an in-depth read of your work and an open, honest, and collaborative discussion of feedback. $50/hour</p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p><< Coaching / Writing Sherpa >></p>

				<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<p>As an ICF-certified Mindfulness, Wellness and Somatic Coach, I've worked with clients to move through periods of self-doubt, self-criticism, anxiety, and other issues that can get in the way of the writing process. Using meditation and other somatic practices, we can work together to get you past that place where you're feeling stuck, clearing space so you can access your innate creative force. $75/hour</p>
